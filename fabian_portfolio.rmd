# Introduction
To track my personal weight loss journey, i collected a dataset using my smartwatch, a kitchen scale, a bathroom scale and the google fit app that contains hours of sleep, calories cosumed, calories used, and my body weight in pounds.

![My Smartwatch](watch.jpeg){height=2%}

```{r}
october_data <- read.table("october_data.txt", header=TRUE)
```
# Student T-test


# Fishers exact test
To meet meet my weight loss goals i set a daily calorie deficit target of 1000.
Here will examine if i hit my target more or less frequently on days with good sleep(that is, hours >= 8)

## null hypothesis
Getting good sleep has no impact on whether i hit my caloric deficit target.

```{r}
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
october_data$Sleep.Hours.[good_sleep]
```
