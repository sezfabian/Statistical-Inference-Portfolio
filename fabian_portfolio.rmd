# Introduction
To track my personal weight loss journey, i collected a dataset using my smart watch, a kitchen scale, a bathroom scale and the google fit app that contains hours of sleep, calories cosumed, calories used, and my body weight in pounds, with each row representing a day of the month.

![My Smartwatch](watch.jpeg){width=100%}

```{r}
october_data <- read.table("october_data.txt", header=TRUE)
head(october_data, 5)
```
## Student T-test
#### a). Weight Change over the month of October (One-sided t-test)
|        Here I will examine whether my body weight significantly changed between the first half and second half of the month of October.

* ___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: There is no difference in my body weight between the first and second half of the month od October.  
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: My mean body weight is lower in the second half of the month compared to the first half of the month.

```{r indent = "     "}
# Student t-test comparing mean of body weight recorded in the second half of the month against the first half of the month.
second_half <- as.Date(october_data$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y") >= "2025-10-16"
ans <- t.test(october_data$Weight.lbs.[second_half],october_data$Weight.lbs.[!second_half], alternative = "less")
# Mean Values
ans$estimate
# P-value
ans$p.value
```
___One-sided test Justification___: Based on general knowledge and observations I expect my body weight to reduce from maintaining a calorie deficit over a sustained period of time.  
___Statistical interpretation___: P-value < 0.05, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This affirms the alternate hypothesis that my my body weight decreased.
__Contextual interpretation__: Over the course of the month of October, my body weight shows a statistically significant decrease that aligns with my weight loss goals that can be attributed to having maintained a calorie deficit on most days of the month.  
  


#### b). Impact of good sleep on daily activity and calories consumed (Two-sided t-test )
i. __Daily Activity (Calories Used)__  
Here I will examine whether I was more or less active(used more/less calories) on days that I had good(enough) sleep where good sleep is defined by the adult standard of 8-hours sleep.  
___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: Getting good sleep has no impact on whether I am more or less active during the day.  
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: Good sleep impacts how active I am during the day.

```{r indent = "     "}
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
ans <- t.test(october_data$Calories_Used[good_sleep],october_data$Calories_Used[!good_sleep])
# Mean Values
ans$estimate
# P-value
ans$p.value
```
___Two-sided test Justification___: Daily activity can increase or decrease with good sleep as sleeping more could mean having a less active day as more time is spent sleeping or having enough rest to be more active during the day.
___Statistical interpretation___: P-value > 0.05, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis, thus: Getting good sleep has no impact on whether I am more or less active during the day.  
__Contextual interpretation__: Despite a difference in the calculated mean of calories used on days with good sleep and days without good sleep, the t-test analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in my daily activity, between days with good sleep and days without. This implies that daily activity is not associated with sleep. 

ii. __Food intake (Calories Consumed)__  
Here I will examine whether I consumed more or less calories on days that I had good(enough) sleep, where good sleep is defined by the adult standard of 8-hours sleep.  
___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: Getting good sleep has no impact on the amount of calories consumed during the day.  
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: Good sleep impacts how much food(calories) I consumed during the day.

```{r indent = "     "}
ans <- t.test(october_data$Calories_Consumed[good_sleep],october_data$Calories_Consumed[!good_sleep])
# Mean Values
ans$estimate
# P-value
ans$p.value
```
___Two-sided test Justification___: Sleeping 8 or more hours could affect the calories I consume in both directions. Sleep may or may not affect both the amount of food and the type of food I consume. 
___Statistical interpretation___: P-value > 0.05, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis, thus: Getting good sleep has no impact on the amount of calories consumed during the day.  
__Contextual interpretation__: Despite a difference in the calculated mean of calories consumed on days with good sleep and days without good sleep, the t-test analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in the mean. We observe that my eating habits are independent of whether I had enough sleep or not.


# Linear regression
My dataset includes 4 key independent variables(sleep(hrs), calories_consumed, calories_used, and weight(lbs)).The collected data is noisy as i did not use exact methods for measurement/collection of the data. In this section I will analyze the variables to map relationships and use the modeled relationships to influence my weight loss journey.
```{r}
plot(Calories_Used~Sleep.Hours., data=october_data, col="red" )
points(Calories_Consumed~Sleep.Hours.,  data=october_data, col="blue")
```

```{r}
plot(log10(Calories_Used)~Sleep.Hours., data=october_data)
abline(lm(log10(Calories_Used)~Sleep.Hours., data=october_data))
```

# Fishers exact test
To meet meet my weight loss goals i set a daily calorie deficit target of 1000.
Here will examine if i hit my target more or less frequently on days with good sleep(that is, hours >= 8)

## null hypothesis
Getting good sleep has no impact on whether i hit my caloric deficit target.

```{r}
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
october_data$Sleep.Hours.[good_sleep]
october_data$Caloric_Difference
```
