# Introduction
To track my personal weight loss journey, i collected a dataset using my smart watch, a kitchen scale, a bathroom scale and the google fit app that contains hours of sleep, calories cosumed, calories used, and my body weight in pounds, with each row representing a day of the month.

![My Smartwatch](watch.jpeg){width=100%}

```{r}
october_data <- read.table("october_data.txt", header=TRUE)
head(october_data, 5)
```
## Student T-test
#### a). Weight Change
|        Here I will examine whether my body weight significantly changed between the first half and second half of the month of October.
* __Null Hypothesis(H₀)__: There is no difference in my body weight between the first and second half of the month od October.  
__Alternative Hypothesis(H1)__: My mean body weight is lower in the second half of the month compared to the first half of the month.

```{r indent = "     "}
# Student t-test comparing mean of body weight recorded in the second half of the month against the first half of the month.
second_half <- as.Date(october_data$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y") >= "2025-10-16"
ans <- t.test(october_data$Weight.lbs.[second_half],october_data$Weight.lbs.[!second_half], alternative = "less")
# Mean Values
ans$estimate
# P-value
ans$p.value
```
__One-sided test Justification__: Based on general knowledge and observations I expect my body weight to reduce from maintaining a calorie deficit over a sustained period of time.
+ 

##### a). Impact of good sleep on calories consumed.
+ Here I will examine whether I consumed more or less calories on days that I had enough sleep.

```{r indent = "     "}
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
mean(october_data$Calories_Consumed[good_sleep])
mean(october_data$Calories_Consumed[!good_sleep])
t.test(october_data$Calories_Consumed[good_sleep],october_data$Calories_Consumed[!good_sleep])
```

##### a). Impact of good sleep on daily activity(calories used).
Here I will examine whether I was more or less active(used more/less calories) on days that I had enough sleep.

```{r indent = "     "}
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
mean(october_data$Calories_Used[good_sleep])
mean(october_data$Calories_Used[!good_sleep])
t.test(october_data$Calories_Used[good_sleep],october_data$Calories_Used[!good_sleep])
```
# Linear regression
My dataset includes 4 key independent variables(sleep(hrs), calories_consumed, calories_used, and weight(lbs)).The collected data is noisy as i did not use exact methods for measurement/collection of the data. In this section I will analyze the variables to map relationships and use the modeled relationships to influence my weight loss journey.
```{r}
plot(Calories_Used~Sleep.Hours., data=october_data, col="red" )
points(Calories_Consumed~Sleep.Hours.,  data=october_data, col="blue")
```

```{r}
plot(log10(Calories_Used)~Sleep.Hours., data=october_data)
abline(lm(log10(Calories_Used)~Sleep.Hours., data=october_data))
```

# Fishers exact test
To meet meet my weight loss goals i set a daily calorie deficit target of 1000.
Here will examine if i hit my target more or less frequently on days with good sleep(that is, hours >= 8)

## null hypothesis
Getting good sleep has no impact on whether i hit my caloric deficit target.

```{r}
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
october_data$Sleep.Hours.[good_sleep]
october_data$Caloric_Difference
```
