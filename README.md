A Statistical analysis of the impact of sleep on my personal weight loss journey using smartwatch sleep tracking and activity data, with manual calorie intake tracking.

## Overview

In this project, I statistically analyze my weight loss data collected over October 2025, combining:
- **Smartwatch data**: Daily calorie expenditure estimates from activity and sleep tracking
- **Manual tracking**: Daily calorie intake logged manually
- **Goal**: Achieve a -1000 calorie daily deficit for healthy weight loss

## Dataset

The dataset includes daily measurements of:
- Sleep duration
- Calories burned (from smartwatch & Google Fit)
- Calories consumed (manual logging)
- Calorie deficit
