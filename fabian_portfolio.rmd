# Introduction
To track my personal weight loss journey, i collected a dataset using my smart watch, a kitchen scale, a bathroom scale and the google fit app that contains hours of sleep, calories cosumed, calories used, and my body weight in pounds, with each row representing a day of the month.

![My Smartwatch](watch.jpeg){width=100%}

```{r}
october_data <- read.table("october_data.txt", header=TRUE)
head(october_data, 5)
```
## Student T-test
#### a). Weight Change over the month of October (One-sided t-test)
|        Here I will examine whether my body weight significantly changed between the first half and second half of the month of October.

* ___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: There is no difference in my body weight between the first and second half of the month od October.  
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: My mean body weight is lower in the second half of the month compared to the first half of the month.

```{r indent = "     "}
# Student t-test comparing mean of body weight recorded in the second half of the month against the first half of the month.
# Covert 'Date' from string to Date format 
october_data$Date <- as.Date(october_data$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
# Split data between to two halves by date 
second_half <- october_data$Date >= "2025-10-16"
# Student t-test
ans <- t.test(october_data$Weight.lbs.[second_half],october_data$Weight.lbs.[!second_half], alternative = "less")
# Mean Values
ans$estimate
# P-value
ans$p.value
```
___One-sided test Justification___: Based on general knowledge and observations I expect my body weight to reduce from maintaining a calorie deficit over a sustained period of time.  
___Statistical interpretation___: P-value < 0.05, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This affirms the alternate hypothesis that my my body weight decreased.
__Contextual interpretation__: Over the course of the month of October, my body weight shows a statistically significant decrease that aligns with my weight loss goals that can be attributed to having maintained a calorie deficit on most days of the month.  
  


#### b). Impact of good sleep on daily activity and calories consumed (Two-sided t-test )
i. __Daily Activity (Calories Used)__  
Here I will examine whether I was more or less active(used more/less calories) on days that I had good(enough) sleep where good sleep is defined by the adult standard of 8-hours sleep.  
___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: Getting good sleep has no impact on whether I am more or less active during the day.  
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: Good sleep impacts how active I am during the day.

```{r indent = "     "}
# Split data into two based on number of hours of sleep
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
# Student t-test
ans <- t.test(october_data$Calories_Used[good_sleep],october_data$Calories_Used[!good_sleep])
# Mean Values
ans$estimate
# P-value
ans$p.value
```
___Two-sided test Justification___: Daily activity can increase or decrease with good sleep as sleeping more could mean having a less active day as more time is spent sleeping or having enough rest to be more active during the day.
___Statistical interpretation___: P-value > 0.05, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis, thus: Getting good sleep has no impact on whether I am more or less active during the day.  
__Contextual interpretation__: Despite a difference in the calculated mean of calories used on days with good sleep and days without good sleep, the t-test analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in my daily activity, between days with good sleep and days without. This implies that daily activity is not associated with sleep. 

ii. __Food intake (Calories Consumed)__  
Here I will examine whether I consumed more or less calories on days that I had good(enough) sleep, where good sleep is defined by the adult standard of 8-hours sleep.  
___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: Getting good sleep has no impact on the amount of calories consumed during the day.  
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: Good sleep impacts how much food(calories) I consumed during the day.

```{r indent = "     "}
# Student t-test
ans <- t.test(october_data$Calories_Consumed[good_sleep],october_data$Calories_Consumed[!good_sleep])
# Mean Values
ans$estimate
# P-value
ans$p.value
```
___Two-sided test Justification___: Sleeping 8 or more hours could affect the calories I consume in both directions. Sleep may or may not affect both the amount of food and the type of food I consume. 
___Statistical interpretation___: P-value > 0.05, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis, thus: Getting good sleep has no impact on the amount of calories consumed during the day.  
__Contextual interpretation__: Despite a difference in the calculated mean of calories consumed on days with good sleep and days without good sleep, the t-test analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in the mean. We observe that my eating habits are independent of whether I had enough sleep or not.


## Linear regression
My dataset includes 4 key independent variables (sleep (hrs), calories_consumed, calories_used, and weight(lbs)). The collected data is noisy as I did not use neither exact methods nor perfect equipment for measurement/collection of the data.  
In this section I will analyze the variables to map relationships and check if I can use the modeled relationships to influence my weight loss journey.

#### a). Weight loss trend analysis.
- Here I am examining whether my body weight decreases with liner trend through out the month of October

```{r indent = "     "}
# Scatter plot of weight against date
plot(Weight.lbs.~Date, data=october_data, col="red" )
```

- From the plot i can observe that there exists some type of linear relationship between weight and  time in days. I will hence use linear regression to determine if I can define mapping relationship of body weight to time(days) given my activity and eating habits remain consistent with the collected data.  
___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: My Body weight does not have a linear trend over time, in the month of October(β = 0).   
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: My Body weight decreased linearly over time in the month of October, (β > 0)

```{r indent = "     "}
october_data$Time.days. <- seq(from=1, to=31)
# Scatter plot of weight against date
plot(Weight.lbs.~Time.days., data=october_data, col="red" )
# Liner model fit
line_fit <- lm(Weight.lbs.~Time.days., data=october_data)
# Plot linear model
abline(line_fit)
# Summary Linear model
summary(line_fit)
```
___One-sided test Justification___: From the collected data, we have a sustained caloric difference over the month. It is hence expected for weight to decrease over time.  
___Statistical interpretation___: 
The y-intercept(𝛼) estimate is 232.29097, and the slope(𝛽) estimate is -0.26073 hence the fitted model is:  
$y_i = 232.29097 - 0.26073x_i + \epsilon_i$  
The correlation coefficient R-squared = 0.7441. This is closer to one, indicating that the model is a strong fit.  
We observe that two sided P-value < 0.05, our one-sided P-value is P-value/2 which is extremely small i.e <<< 0.05, thus the fitted model is highly significant. We fail to reject the null hypothesis, hence affirm the alternative, that my Body weight decreased by approximately 0.26 pounds per day over the month of October.  
__Contextual interpretation__: Maintaining a calorie deficit over the month of October resulted in an almost directly related decrease in body weight despite variance from that could stem from ignored factors like food mass, waste and water consumption.  

#### b). Caloric deficit against Weight Change.
- According to the first law of thermodynamics, a difference between calories consumed and calories used should result in a proportional change in body mass. However, the collected data does not account for all variables that impact body mass like water and waste mass.  
Here, I am examining whether we can predict daily body weight change using the calorie deficit.

```{r indent = "     "}
# Calculate change in body weight 
october_data$Weight_change <- c(NA, diff(october_data$Weight.lbs.))
# Plot change in body against calorie deficit
plot(Weight_change~Caloric_Difference, data=october_data, col="red" )
```
- From the scatter plot we cannot establish any kind of relationship between the days calculated change in body weight and the recorded calorie deficit. To test this, I am using liner regression to determine if we can predict change in body weight on a daily basis from calorie deficit.  
___Null Hypothesis(H₀)___: There is no a linear relationship between caloric deficit in a day and the change in body weight over the same period of time (β = 0).    
___Alternative Hypothesis(H1)___: Body weight changes proportionally to caloric deficit on a daily basis (β > 0)

```{r indent = "     "}
# Linear model fit
line_fit <- lm(Weight_change~Caloric_Difference, data=october_data)
# Model summary
summary(line_fit)
```
___One-sided test Justification___: Based on the principles of thermodynamics, we expect a higher change in body weight for higher calorie deficit.   
___Statistical interpretation___: 
The y-intercept(𝛼) estimate is 232.29097, and the slope(𝛽) estimate is -0.26073 hence the fitted model is:  
$y_i = 232.29097 - 0.26073x_i + \epsilon_i$  
The correlation coefficient R-squared = 0.7441. This is closer to one, indicating that the model is a strong fit.  
We observe that two sided P-value < 0.05, our one-sided P-value is P-value/2 which is extremely small i.e <<< 0.05, thus the fitted model is highly significant. We fail to reject the null hypothesis, hence affirm the alternative, that my Body weight decreased by approximately 0.26 pounds per day over the month of October.  
__Contextual interpretation__: Maintaining a calorie deficit over the month of October resulted in an almost directly related decrease in body weight despite variance from that could stem from ignored factors like food mass quantity and water consumption.  




# Fishers exact test
To meet meet my weight loss goals i set a daily calorie deficit target of 1000.
Here will examine if i hit my target more or less frequently on days with good sleep(that is, hours >= 8)

## null hypothesis
Getting good sleep has no impact on whether i hit my caloric deficit target.

```{r}
good_sleep <- october_data$Sleep.Hours >= 8
october_data$Sleep.Hours.[good_sleep]
october_data$Caloric_Difference
```
